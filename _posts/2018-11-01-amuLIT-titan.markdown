# The flavors of amuLIT

Last weekend at [SCG Charlotte](http://www.starcitygames.com/decks/results/format/28/event_ID/47/start_date/27-10-2018/end_date/27-10-2018/city/Charlotte/state/NC/start/1/finish/32/w_perc/0/g_perc/0/r_perc/0/b_perc/0/u_perc/0/a_perc/0/order_1/finish/limit/50/start_num/0/) showed two Amulet Titan lists in the top 8 -- placing 1st AND 2nd. It's primetime for primetime! Interestingly enough, the two lists that placed first are essentially the two archetypes that define the Amulet Titan list that we play today, following the [banning](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/january-18-2016-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2016-01-18) of [Summer Bloom](https://scryfall.com/card/9ed/273/summer-bloom). In essence, Summer Bloom is replaced by [Sakura Tribe Scout](https://scryfall.com/card/sok/144/sakura-tribe-scout) and [Azusa, Lost but Seeking](https://scryfall.com/card/a25/161/azusa-lost-but-seeking).

However -- one list plays a build around [Lotus Bloom](https://scryfall.com/card/mma/208/lotus-bloom). A list innovated by, and  popularized by, [PuntThenWhine](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/player/PuntThenWhine). Legend has it that Punt bought into "Bloom Titan" merely a week before the ban -- and he stuck with it, eventually coming up with the basics that define the Lotus Bloom list today. This list, compared to the stock build-out (more on that later), harkens back to the original Bloom Titan lists by running Hive Mind in the main, and even has multiple pact of negations. This list is more combo focused, where the stock build out tips the scales towards being able to transition further into a midrange plan. Granted -- both either job fairly well.

The list placing first, by Will Pulliam, is what I would call the stock build out for Amulet Titan. Granted -- this does have some state-of-the-art tech in it. Very similar to [what yours truly played](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c1dRfby8YhXRQIDDAzWw0V4KD2uyvPeK/view?usp=sharing) a couple weeks previous at a 10k in Worcester, Mass. This includes playing 2-3 copies of [Adventurous Impulse](https://scryfall.com/card/dom/153/adventurous-impulse) main, and an [Emrakul, The Promised End](https://scryfall.com/card/emn/6/emrakul-the-promised-end) in the side. The idea here being that Emmy's a trump card against control matchups (and even Tron, which sometimes we grind against). The land base is fairly solid here -- sometimes you'll see some tweaks for more red -- which is important especially in the sideboard. For example: 4 Gruul turfs and cut a Selesnya Sanctuary, sometimes substitute a a Grove of the Burnwillows instead of a forest. Note that it's considered standard to run 28 lands, the lists running Adventurous Impulse have trimmed down to 27 -- the typical cut here is to shave a forest. Sometimes you'll find a heavier white build out for sideboard options, like this [Daryl Ayer's list](https://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=19522&d=324870&f=MO).

In this list, the spots I'd consider flex are: Rec sage, Adventurous Impulse, and Explore. You'll see a lot of lists running 0-4 Explore. Usually erring on more Explore (it can enable turn 2 combos!). It's often a first-to-cut card when sideboarding when you're trying to lower your curve. Some people consider the 4th Azusa a flex spot (personally, I'd rather see Azusa too often than not see her enough). Other things you'll see appear in these spots are [Courser of Kruphix](https://scryfall.com/card/a25/164/courser-of-kruphix), mainboard [Obstinate Baloth](https://scryfall.com/card/ima/179/obstinate-baloth), rarely a [Wurmcoil Engine](https://scryfall.com/card/cm2/231/wurmcoil-engine)

[Austin Robbins](https://www.twitch.tv/itzautin), placing second -- was on the Lotus Bloom list -- and is a regular of the Amulet Titan discord -- I couldn't believe it when I turned on Twitch and saw that he was facing down Ross Merriam on Dredge. I posted immediately to the #videos channel on the discord, and the discord started explode -- what a great day for Amulet Titan. If you're an Amulet player, I highly recommend joining the discord. The invitation links expire, so I recommend joining a streamer's chat and asking for an invite there -- someone will be able to post a link for you.

## Streamers to watch

* [Davius Minimus](https://www.twitch.tv/daviusminimus)

Don't miss Davius. I'd consider him the premier Amulet streamer. He's been playing the deck for a *long* time. He's credited with a lot of the tech that we use today. There's probably more, but, he's definitely the guy who popularized spell pierce in the side -- typically we use it even as a 3 of today. He's tested almost everything that we play, and that we *don't* play. Really clear explanation of lines, good insight on sideboarding, and knows the history of the deck and understands the meta as it changes around us.

* [Fpawlusz](https://www.twitch.tv/fpawlusz)

Fransisco is nothing to sneeze at -- this guy is *amazing*. He's a musician by trade and a born performer, he's entertaining enough to watch for hours on stream. Fransisco also streams regularly during the week and has a rapidly growing fan base. He's up to date on the latest tech, and often runs it. You can also have him test some tech in a deck for you for a palty $12 and loan him the MODO cards. 

* [DJ Benji](https://www.twitch.tv/djbenji21)

DJ is one of my personal favorite streamers, a really active member of the Amulet community, and a genuinely nice guy. DJ shows up as a watcher in a lot of streams, and then we get to see his play, too.

* [Edgar Magalhaes](https://twitter.com/EdgarMTG)

An MTG gold pro, and definitely a major Amulet guy. What else can I say?!

## Spice it up

One of the ultimate guys in adding spice in the Discord is [Lord's Servant](https://www.twitch.tv/lords_serv) -- who is also a streamer. 

Lord has some of the coolest deck lists for Amulet -- my two favorites being:

* [Academy Titan](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/academy-titan-og/)

What's better than running engineered explosives main? Having nearly infinite copies of it from recurring it with [Academy Ruins](https://scryfall.com/card/mma/219/academy-ruins). Oh yeah, and you can do the same with walking ballista, wurmcoil engine -- and even get a [Mindslaver](https://scryfall.com/card/som/176/mindslaver) lock out of the sideboard.

* [Zendikar Titan](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/zendikar-titan/)

A Valakut list!? Yep! The gist is that you play out [Prismatic Omen](https://scryfall.com/card/shm/126/prismatic-omen) making all your jank Karoo's also mountains, tutor up a valakut, and then dome your opponent with Valakut triggers with primetime triggers or even Azusa and bouncelands -- "feels good" only beings to describe it.
